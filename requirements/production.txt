# django-registration throws `django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady` with

# we remove django-registration as a dependecy.
django==1.6
# This version is hardcoded because of a bug
# (https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework/issues/1237). As soon
# as it is fixed we should relax this requirement.
